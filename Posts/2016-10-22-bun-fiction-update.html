            We are working on a story for next Saturday. Lining up at the tar pits was all we could handle this week.

        <div class="story-txt">
            Next time, Pancake and Mr. Toes will go on a test flight with a couple of corporate suits to show them what happens when the ivory tower loses touch with the launch tower.

            We started working on a dedicated, separate site/blog to host bun fiction. Don't worry; you'll hear all about the new episodes right here first. We think it's best to let the Disapproving Bun focused on disapproving first. Maybe bun fiction can stand on its own?

            As always, we're happy to hear your thoughts.
